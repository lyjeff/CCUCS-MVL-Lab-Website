                        It is a new field in machine learning research, and its concept is derived from the study of neural networks. In the field of computer vision, image processing and other fields have great potential for development. Deep learning methods are used to simulate how the human brain thinks, mimicking the mechanisms of the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and text. Taking images as an example, by combining low-level image features, the concepts of intermediate edges, shapes, and the like are developed, and then higher-level meanings, such as objects or faces, are learned.</p>

There are many deep learning techniques that are used in everyday life of humans such as autonomous vehicles and face recognition systems. Nowadays, the gradual dependence of human daily life on deep neural networks can lead to serious consequences, so the security of neural networks becomes very important. Therefore, the deep neural network has obvious weaknesses. We propose a method based on generating a confrontation network to generate a facial makeup picture that can deceive the face recognition system. We hide the perturbation of the attack in the results of the abnormal makeup photos that humans can’t detect. The experimental results show that we can not only generate high-quality facial makeup images, but also our attack results have a high attack success rate in the face recognition system.

                        The music rhythm game is currently a very popular game, and we propose to generate a music rhythm game spectrum based on the method of Generative Adversarial Network. The music is separated into two parts: the vocal and the soundtrack, which makes the generated spectrum closer to the real spectrum. The model consists of two concepts of Generative Adversarial Network: Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGANs) for music information and Improved Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) for better convergence of the model.

                        We propose a fully automated system that converts random graffiti into a painting. However, this is a serious challenge because the input graffiti can be very messy and hide multiple objects, so finding the correlation between these repeated lines and multiple objects is not a simple matter. In the system, we use selective search, sparse coding and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in which we use selective search to find the part of the object that may be the object of the graffiti; then use sparse coding to find the corresponding element; CNN sets the style to be converted. The final experimental results show that the methods we use have superior performance and produce artistic works.

                        With the popularity of wearable devices in recent years, the application of motion recognition through the sensing it collects has become more and more important. In the field of computer vision, human motion recognition is becoming more and more important. In motion recognition, a large number of sensing data collected by multi-axis wear devices are also used to perform motion recognition. Deep learning is seen as the most promising way to solve many computer vision problems in machine learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most concerned methods in deep learning. We propose the architecture of MP-CNN, which contains two new components of D-CNN and S-CNN to identify the motion data. In D-CNN, we use GMM to get each in the training phase. The distribution of actions, then the GLR and GMMs are used to partition the input signal data and channel calibration, and each input information is mapped to the corresponding CNN channel. Therefore, we also propose an LZW-based S-CNN architecture that uses CNN to construct the relationship between state, input information and transition probability to automatically convert the sensed data to state transition probability. Finally, D-CNN and S-CNN are combined into MP-CNN to improve the overall architecture performance.

                        The goal of this project is to compare low-resolution face images to verify that they are the same person. In today’s unrestricted environment, the effectiveness of face recognition often decreases due to posture factors, so we establish a normalization method to restore any face angle, thereby returning the face angle of any state to increase The effectiveness of face recognition. The project uses two Caffe model architectures: Matching-Convolutional NeuralNetwork (M-CNN) and Siamese Neural Network (SNN). Finally, the accuracy of the SNN model is more than 90%, which is higher than that of M-CNN.

                        In recent years, sparse coding has been very popular in the field of computer vision and image processing. Sparse coding consists of a linear combination of input data, dictionary and input data. Sparse coding can be used for image denoising, restoration, and classification. The laboratory focuses on two research directions based on sparse coding: multiple attribute image classification and sparse coding of huge amounts of data.

                        With the emergence of huge datasets such as ImageNet, designing a classifier that can process large amounts of data and effectively classify it is a major issue in the field of computer vision. The performance of sparse coding depends on the quality of the dictionary. If you can learn a good dictionary, the performance of sparse coding will naturally be good. The research direction of Our laboratory for massive data is sparse coding representation of huge data and sparse coding dictionary learning of huge data.
